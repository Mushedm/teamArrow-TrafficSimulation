\noindent \textbf{When will the team work together and what tools will it use to work outside meeting hours?}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent The team will work together every Wednesday and will use Facebook Messenger to communicate and Team Viewer to work at home. 

\vspace{1em}
\noindent \textbf{Who is the project coordinator and what is his role?}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent Mohammad Ali Syed will be the project coordinator and will be responsible for maintaining communication between all team members and organising the required deliverables and submitting them. 

\vspace{1em}
\noindent \textbf{How will the project be divided between team members?}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent \textbf{The following table will be used to note team members contributions. Contributions will be measured through hours contributed in the report and number of features implemented in the tool. Each member should ideally contribute to every aspect of the project in one way or the other. The table shows in percentage how much each member will contribute.}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent \textbf{How will team members assess each other?}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent Each team member will receive a mark from 0-20 from other members and the average of these marks will be the mark for project calculated to the nearest whole number. An example is shown below. 

\begin{table}[ht]

\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c|c|c| } 
\hline
Grader & Ali & Alexander & Hesham & Mushed & Rahul\\

\hline
Grade by Alexander & 18&\-&18&18&20\\

\end{table}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent \textbf{How will potential conflicts be handled and resolved?}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent The most important aspect about team work is communication. Every individual idea or criticism will have to be communicated to every team member. We believe that every opinion should be respected and valued. If there is an unlikely situation of an extreme disagreement, the team will report this to the project supervisor.  

\vspace{1em}
\noindent \textbf{What is the timeline of the project?}
